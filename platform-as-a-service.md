# Guide for Web Deployment with Python

## Platform-as-a-service

There are several companies that provide a platform-as-a-service (or 
PaaS) available for Python. Among theirs advantages are:

* Removes the need to know as much about the underlying servers, 
operating system, web server, and often the WSGI server.
* Provides a higher-level abstraction (such as web and WSGI servers, 
operating system and server hardware) for working with computing 
resources than deploying an application to a server or IaaS.
* Makes deployment and operations easier because it forces the developer 
to conform applications to the PaaS architecture.
* Skips configuration of an operating system and web server prebaked 
into PaaS offerings.
